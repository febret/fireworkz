- Revised game code to introduce mid /act sequences.
- Game fully working through levels. Transition between acts now looks better.
- Game slows down too much in last two acts.
- Fixed speed problems, it was depending on glows apparently.
- Added background music, explosion and launch sounds.
- Added new sounds, applause, boo, and music looping now works correctly.
- Added sound enable / disable button
- Finalized Main and guide screen.
- Done next level and level success screens. 
- Removed game finished screen.
- worked on some last minute fixes. 
- Linked to new leaderboards.
- Game now gets directly to new game after game over without passing to main screen. This
was done mainly to avoid a couple bugs that showed up in the main screen after a game over.

FINAL TOUGHTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Initial work was not on gameplay but on appearance, because in this game eye candy was
particularly important.
- Lots of trial and error on visual side. Initial approach (realistic fireworks) was
totally on the wrong road. Creating more cartoonish in style was both easier and visually appealing.
- Initial idea about gameplay has been changed, I didn't have to try it to to understand it was worng
so luckily I did not spend a lot of time implementing it. Being able to analyze gameplay without requiring 
a fully working prototype can really save time. Something similar happened with atomz but in
that case I had to see a working version to realize it was not fun enough.
- The Game screens for next level, start game, game over etc. were not as polished as I wanted to, but I was out of time.
